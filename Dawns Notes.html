<b> <h1> Dawn Stevenson Notes: <b> Intro To Programming </h1>
<br> In the Intro to Programming Class we learned how to program.<b>
I learned that if I use this code I could make text bold or <em> to intalize <em>.<b>
<!------Notice here I can use the p for paragraph------>
<p> My code may not look terrific now, how once I am completed with this amazing Intro to Programming Class it will begin to look more ike a web page.  For now I am simply enjoying learning as much as I have within the current structure of the class.<p>
<br>
<h1> What is a Web Page </h1>

<p> We learned that a web page is a text document written in languages called HTML.  Web Browser make the document and interpret the code.</p>
<br>
<h1> How Coding Works </h1>

<p> We learned that coding happens when programmers write text in a language that computers understand.  The computer then follow the instruction the programmer wrote i.e. I'm <b> learning to code! </b>
<p>
<h1> Computers Are Stupid <h/1>
<br>
<p> In this lesson we learned that computers are stupid. An example is if you you forget to close a tag, the computer won't be able to interpret what you intended to do i.e. make bold. Something so simple can be quite frustrating. If you know how to talk to a computer then you can tell it do do what you want. This is amazing power! </p>
<br>
<h1> Programmer's Can't Remember Everything <h/1>
<br>
<p> There are a significant amount of information and detail to try to keep in your head. And it's okay of you don't remember it all. If you forget how to do something you can simply just look it up. </p>
<br>
<p> In the next few lessons we will be using HTML in the next few lessons and it will be helful to be comfortable with the jargons. Tag: in HTML is always contained in angled brackets. Most tags have a opening and closing bracket </p> Some tags are called void tags like the <br> tag.
